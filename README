Source files for various camera shutters & intervalometers.

The source code for the intervalometer with 12 DIP switches is sadly
gone.  There is still source code for an earlier intervalometer with 8
DIP switches.  8 DIP switches might actually be enough.

It's simple enough to write a scratch intervalometer in C.  The mane
requirement is to use a 32768 clock to conserve power.  It might be
better off using 8 DIP switches instead of 12.

It was written for mirrored cameras which required a mirror lockup
followed by a shutter pulse.  Modern cameras have no mirror so they can
be driven in continuous mode.  The storage time serves as a delay
between exposures.  Setting 0 for the mirror lockup disabled it.


Configuring the XBee:
// enter command mode
// +++
// set the frequency
// atch0c
// baud rate  07=115200
// atbd07
// flash configuration
// atwr
// exit command mode
// atcn


For foot pedals, it's unfortunate that the unplugged state is the down
state for the Yamaha pedals.  The user has to remember to connect a
jumper when no focus pedal is connected & disconnect the jumper when a
focus pedal is connected.
